# Amazon Behavioral Mock Questions

found a list of behavioral questions on Levels.fyi:
https://www.levels.fyi/blog/amazon-leadership-principles.html

I've created a Python program that asks you one of the 48 questions listed at random. I would recommend videoing yourself responding to the question on the spot to help prepare for the interview.
I've also incorporated a feature to make you guess which leadership principle a question corresponds to. This should also help you in your interview so you know what leadership principle
you should emphasize for a given question.

# Usage
just make sure you have python installed, it should be a simple as running "python3 main.py" in the command line under the project directory.
